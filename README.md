# Variable-Assignment-in-R-programming
In R, variable assignment is typically done using either the <- operator or the = operator. Here are examples of both:
Using <- (recommended in R):

x <- 10
name <- "Patrick Mensah"
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Using = (an alternative way):
x = 10
name = "Patrick Mensah"
numbers = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Assigning a number to a variable
age <- 25

# Assigning a string to a variable
name <- "Patrick Mensah"

# Assigning a vector to a variable
scores <- c(88, 92, 79, 85)

In R, <- is more common and preferred because it makes assignments more explicit, distinguishing them from other operators.
